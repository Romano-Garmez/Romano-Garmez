### Hiya

I'm Roman Garms, a Computer Science major going to University of California Santa Cruz. I'm interested in computers, cars, videography, as well as trying to get tech to do something it's never done before. Big fan of porting Doom to things it never should run on.

```
Familiar with:
- Python
- Java
- Javascript
- C#
- C
- Swift
```

```
My favorite projects:
- Running Doom on a drone controller
- Making my Spotify Now Playing web app designed for a Raspberry Pi
- Creating a Teenage Engineering OP-1 Tombola videopak for the OP-Z
- Tuning my car with a Steam Deck
- Creating custom applications to run on my car's infotainment system
```

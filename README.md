### Hiya

I'm Roman Garms, a Computer Science major going to University of California Santa Cruz. I'm interested in computers, cars, videography, as well as trying to get tech to do something it's never done before. Big fan of porting Doom to things it never should run on.

My favorite projects:

- Creating a Teenage Engineering OP-1 Tombola themed music utility for the OP-Z synthesizer
- Creating custom applications to run on my car's infotainment system
